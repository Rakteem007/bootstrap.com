              Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California, in October 2003
              by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White.[18][19]
              Rubin described the Android project as having "tremendous
              potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware
              of its owner's location and preferences".[19] The early intentions
              of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for
              digital cameras, and this was the basis of its pitch to investors
              in April 2004.[20] The company then decided that the market for
              cameras was not large enough for its goals, and five months later
              it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset
              operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows
              Mobile.[20][21]
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2005, Rubin tried to negotiate deals with Samsung[24] and
              HTC.[25] Shortly afterwards, Google acquired the company in July
              of that year for at least $50 million;[19][26] this was Google's
              "best deal ever" according to Google's then-vice president of
              corporate development, David Lawee, in 2010.[24] Android's key
              employees, including Rubin, Miner, Sears, and White, joined Google
              as part of the acquisition.[19] Not much was known about the
              secretive Android Inc. at the time, with the company having
              provided few details other than that it was making software for
              mobile phones.[19] At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a
              mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google
              marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the
              promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system.[27] Google

              Cyberpunk 2077 is played in a first-person perspective as V,[3] a
              mercenary whose voice,[4] face, hairstyles, body type and
              modifications, background, and clothing are customisable. Stat
              categories—Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical, and Cool—are
              influenced by the character classes that players assume, which are
              NetRunner (hacking), Techie (machinery), and Solo (combat). V must
              consult a "ripperdoc" to upgrade and purchase cyberware implants;
              black markets offer military-grade abilities.[5] The rarity of any
              given equipment is shown by a coloured tier system.[6] V can take
              cover, aim, run, jump, double jump, and slide.[7][8] Melee strikes
              can be dealt with close-combat weapons.[9][10] There are three
              types of ranged weapons, all of which can be customised and
              modified—Power (standard), Tech (which penetrate walls and
              enemies), and Smart (with homing bullets).[11][12] Ranged weapons
              are equipped to ricochet bullets in a target's direction and slow
              them down in bullet time. Four types of damage can be inflicted
              and resisted—Physical, Thermal, EMP, and Chemical.[13][14][15]
              Weapon use increases accuracy and reloading speed, which are
              manifested in character animations.[16] Gunsmiths repair and
              upgrade weapons.[9] The game can be completed without killing
              anyone,[17] with non-lethal options for weapons and cyberware.[18]

              Night City is an American megacity in the Free State of North
              California, controlled by corporations and unassailed by the laws
              of both country and state. It sees conflict from rampant gang wars
              and its ruling entities contending for dominance. The city is
              reliant on robotics for everyday aspects like waste collection,
              maintenance, and public transportation.[31][32] Its visual
              identity is derived from the four eras it underwent—austere
              Entropism, colourful Kitsch, imposing Neo-Militarism, and opulent
              Neo-Kitsch.[33] Homelessness abounds but does not preclude
              cybernetic modification for the poor, giving rise to cosmetic
              addiction and consequent violence. These threats are dealt with by
              the armed force known as Psycho Squad.[34][35] Trauma Team can be
              employed for rapid medical services.[36] Because of the constant
              threat of physical harm, all citizens are allowed to openly carry
              firearms in public.[37]

              Self-described as the "world's foremost innovator of high-tech,
              high-performance communications and security technology",[1] Blume
              Corporation specializes in everything from wireless phone
              operating systems, home computers, to digital imaging processors,
              and linked-by-network security systems. They take great pride in
              the fact that they helped create most of the markets they now
              dominate. Blume stands poised to reshape the way people think
              about Information Security Architecture (ISA).
            </p>
            <p>
              Blume had its own security contractors in Watch Dogs to protect
              the company's major interests like CTOS Control Centers, Blume
              property, etc. These security members could be identified with
              CTOS signs on their gray uniforms. They were notorious for various
              criminal records of its members. In Watch Dogs 2, Blume hires
              Umeni Security Corps to provide security to their facilities. It
              is unknown if this was only for the Bay Area or if Umeni Security
              Corps were also contracted to replace Blume facilities in Chicago
              after the events of Watch Dogs. Blume made many sketchy deals with
              organizations by giving them access to CTOS data and related
              technology like the Bellwether system, in exchange for funding and
              information. This in turn created one of the largest corrupt
              corporate monopolies that even included U.S. government agencies
              such as the FBI.

              Watch Dogs 2 (stylized as WATCH_DOGS 2) is a 2016 action-adventure
              game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is
              the sequel to 2014's Watch Dogs and the second installment in the
              Watch Dogs series. It was released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One
              and Microsoft Windows in November 2016, and Stadia in December
              2020. Set within a fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay
              Area, the game is played from a third-person perspective and its
              open world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Players control
              Marcus Holloway, a hacker who works with the hacking group DedSec
              to take down the city's advanced surveillance system known as
              ctOS. There are multiple ways to complete missions, and each
              successful assignment increases the follower count of DedSec.
              Cooperative multiplayer allows for competitive one-on-one combat
              and connecting with other players to neutralize a player who is
              causing havoc.

              In 2005, Rubin tried to negotiate deals with Samsung[24] and
              Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure
              game with stealth elements[2] and played from a third-person
              perspective as Marcus Holloway, a young hacker. The game features
              an open world set in a fictionalized version of the San Francisco
              Bay Area,[3][4] an area more than twice as large as the
              Chicagoland setting from Watch Dogs.[5] It consists of four
              different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon
              Valley.[6] Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the
              various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks,
              buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes, and boats.[7] The
              driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more
              accessible.[8] The player can shoot their weapons while
              driving.[9] Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the
              ability to parkour around the city.[10] The player can use
              different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing
              between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with
              guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or
              Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee
              cord. Alternatively, the player can use the stealth approach, in
              which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with
              Marcus' taser.[4][10] Watch Dogs 2, like its predecessor, places a
              particular emphasis on using environmental apparatus and the
              terrain to Marcus' advantage. For example, a player may hack an
              A/C unit to produce an electric shock when an enemy nears it.
              Marcus may also employ his own modular taser devices and
              explosives to use tactically against enemies.[11] When law
              enforcement witnesses the player committing a crime, or is alerted
              by a non-player character (NPC), police officers will attempt to
              arrest the player.[12] The game upgrades system is a returning
              feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost,
              Aggressor, and Trickster. Upgrades can be customized according to
              playstyles.[9]

              Invade Inc. is an American multinational technology company that
              specializes in consumer electronics, computer software and online
              services. Apple is the world's largest technology company by
              revenue (totaling $274.5 billion in 2020) and, since January 2021,
              the world's most valuable company. As of 2021, Apple is the
              world's fourth-largest PC vendor by unit sales[9] and
              fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer.[10][11] It is one of the
              Big Five American information technology companies, along with
              Amazon, Google (Alphabet), Facebook (Meta) and
              Microsoft.[12][13][14] Invade was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve
              Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's
              Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak
              as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and sales of its computers,
              including the Apple II, grew quickly. It went public in 1980 to
              instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped
              new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such
              as the original Macintosh, announced with the critically acclaimed
              advertisement "1984". The high price of its products and limited
              application library caused problems, as did power struggles
              between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably,[15]
              while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers
              with him.[16]

              Invade Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve
              Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a business
              partnership.[22][25] The company's first product is the Apple I, a
              computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[26][27] To
              finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of
              transportation, a VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars, and
              Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for US$500 (equivalent to $2,274
              in 2020).[28] Wozniak debuted the first prototype at the Homebrew
              Computer Club in July 1976.[29][30] The Apple I was sold as a
              motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base
              kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal
              computer.[31] It went on sale soon after debut for US$666.66
              (equivalent to $3,032 in 2020).[32][33][34][35][36]: 180  Wozniak
              later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in
              the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he
              liked "repeating digits".[37]
